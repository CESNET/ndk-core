Time Stamp Unit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Time Stamp Unit (TSU) is used to generate accurate time stamps (64b). These time stamps are optionally used by the Network Module to mark the arrival time of individual Ethernet packets. Also, the user has a signal carrying these timestamps available for his user logic in the application core. The Time Stamp Unit is implemented by :ref:`the TSU_GEN component <tsu_gen>`. The nfb-tsu software tool is used to configure and run the TSU. The time stamps are generated by the pulse per second (PPS) signal. This can be generated by the selected clock signal or can be from an external source such as a GPS receiver (if the selected FPGA board supports it).
