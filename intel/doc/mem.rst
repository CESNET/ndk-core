Memory controller (EMIF)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To access external memory (typically DDR4) on an Intel FPGA, our platform uses standard External Memory Interface (EMIF) Hard IP blocks.
These are suitably configured, and their Avalon-MM user interface is integrated into :ref:`the application core <ndk_intel_app>`.
Please read the EMIF user guide and Avalon-MM bus specifications.

.. note::

    The prepared basic application core then contains :ref:`debug modules <mem_tester>` that can test communication with these memories and measure their basic properties (throughput, latency).
